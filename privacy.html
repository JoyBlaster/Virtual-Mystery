  <h2>What is online privacy?</h2>
  <p>Online privacy, also known as Internet privacy or digital privacy, is the ability to control how much of your information (such as browsing, financial, and potentially sensitive personal data) third parties can collect and use when you go online.</p>
  <br><br>
  <h2>Why is online privacy important?</h2>
  <p>In recent years, the importance of Internet privacy has grown tremendously since related cyber threats often put usersâ€™ security at enormous risk. While technology advances, people tend to digitize almost all spheres of their lives, from managing their finances to communicating with friends and buying goods. But the more information we share online, the greater the chance for threat actors to compromise it. </p>
