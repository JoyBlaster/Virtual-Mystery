  <h2>What is fact-checking</h2>
  <p>Fact-checking is when a person checks the facts of a story or a news article to make sure they are true and are not trying to deceive them.</p>
<h3>How to fact check?</h3>
  <p>Here is some important things to take note of if you want to fact check properly</p>
  <h3>Check credentials</h3>
  <p>Check Credentials - Is the author specialized in the field that the article is concerned with? Does s/he currently work in that field? Check LinkedIn or do a quick Google search to see if the author can speak about he subject with authority and accuracy.</p>
  <h3>Read the "about us" section</h3>
  <p>Does the resource have one? It may be on a tab at the top of the page, or a link at the bottom of the page, but all reputable websites will have some type of About Us section and will provide a way for you to contact them.</p>
  <h3>Look for bias</h3>
  <p>does the article seem to lean toward a particular point of view? Does it link to sites, files, or images that seem to skew left or right? Biased articles may not be giving you the whole story.</p>
  <h3>Check the dates</h3>
  <p>Like eggs and milk, information can have an expiration date. In many cases, use the most up-to-date information you can find.</p>
  <h3>Check out the source</h3>
  <p>When an article cites sources, it's good to check them out. Sometimes, official-sounding associations are really biased think tanks or represent only a fringe view of a large group of people. If you can't find sources, read as much about the topic as you can to get a feel for what's already out there and decide for your self if the article is accurate or not.</p>
  <h3>Interrogate urls</h3>
  <p> We see quite a bit of domain manipulation these days. For instance, what looks like an .edu domain, followed by .co or “lo” is likely a fake or deceptive site.  If you are you seeing a slightly variant version of a well-known URL, do a little investigating. This is also how some scammers get to trick people with fake websites identical to the real ones</p>
  <h3>Who owns the website that is posting the information online?</h3>
  <p>You can find out at either https://whois.domaintools.com or at https://whois.icann.org. Both of these websites allow you to perform a WHOIS search. Whenever someone registers a website address, they are required to enter their contact information. When you get to your WHOIS search, enter in the domain (the first part of the website URL). This step can be used to collect all the information when you question a source, or the informations purpose.</p>
  <h3>Suspect the sensational</h3>
  <p>When you see something posted that looks sensational, it is even more important to be skeptical. Exaggerated and provocative headlines with excessive use of capital letters or emotional language are serious red flags.</p>
  <h3>Judge Hard</h3>
  <p>If what you are reading seems too good to be true, it probably is</p>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>If something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Fact-checking is a good way to make sure that what you are getting is true and non-bias. It is important not to get emotional reading news and judge it with a fair and clear mind to see if it is true or not</p>
