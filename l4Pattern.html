  <h2>What is pattern recognition?</h2>
  <p>Also known as data and information visualisation, pattern recognition involves sifting through information to find similar problems. Identifying patterns makes it easier to organise data, which in turn can help with problem solving. </p>
  <h2>Why is pattern recognition important?</h2>
  <p>Pattern recognition is a critical tool in computational thinking because it helps to simplify problems and improve comprehension of intricacies. Pattern recognition in computational thinking uses the identification of similarities within a particular data set or sequence to simplify understanding and resolution of a problem or goal. </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Examples of pattern recognition in real life</h2>
  <h2>Driving</h2>
  <p>In driving, we use pattern recognition to predict and respond to different traffic patterns processes. For instance, we may recognize that an upcoming timed traffic light has turned yellow. We know that the pattern of process at the timed lights in the area is for the cross-traffic turn lanes to turn next, then straight cross-traffic, the turn lanes in our direction, then finally our light will turn green. We automatically process this pattern and can reasonably predict how much time we have before the light will turn green.</p>
  <h2>Mathematical Formulas</h2>
  <p>One example of pattern recognition in everyday life is in mathematical formulas that we may use regularly, such as for tipping, converting measurements, determining mpg(Miles per gallon) of a vehicle, etc. All mathematical formulas are a result of and used in pattern recognition and algorithmic thinking. Formulas were created after patterns were identified and applied to create a common solution. Comparably, formulas can be used in mathematics by using pattern recognition to identify situations in which a particular formula may or may not be useful.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Pattern recognition is useful in everyday life by being able to recognise patterns in daily life will make tasks easier to do because you are familiar on how to do them</p>
