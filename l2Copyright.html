  <h2>What is copyright</h2>
  <p>Copyright refers to the legal right of the owner of intellectual property. In simple terms, copyright is the right to copy. This means that the original creators of products and anyone they give authorization to are the only ones with the exclusive right to reproduce the work. This is a very important right to have, as it protects the creator of their work to protect it</p>
  <br>
  <h2>What is Plagiarism?</h2>
  <p>Plagiarism occurs when a party attempts to pass someone else’s work or ideas off as their own, without properly giving credit to the original source.</p>
  <p>Plagiarism, while not against the law, is an ethical construct most enforced by academic intuitions. Consequences of academic plagiarism may result in receiving a failing grade, or worse.</p>
  <p>Plagiarism is not just limited to the academic setting. In the professional world, plagiarism has its own set of consequences, which may include sullying the plagiarizer’s reputation and in some instances termination and difficulty finding new employment. </p>
  <br>
  <h2>What is Copyright Infringement?</h2>
  <p>Copyright, at its core, is the set of rights belonging to the creator or owner of a work of authorship that is original and fixed in a tangible medium of expression. This set of rights automatically vests to someone who creates an original work of authorship like a song, literary work, movie, or photograph.</p>
  <p>These rights allow a copyright owner to control who, when, where, and how their work is used, such as through the right to reproduce the work, to prepare derivative works, to distribute copies, and to perform and display the work publicly.</p>
  <p>Copyright infringement occurs when a party takes an action that implicates one or more of the rights listed above without authorization from the copyright owner or an applicable exception or limitation in the copyright law, such as fair use. </p>
  <p>There can be significant legal consequences for copyright infringement, including injunctions, monetary damages, and in extreme instances criminal penalties.</p>
  <br>
