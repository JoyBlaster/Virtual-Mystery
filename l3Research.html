  <h1>Research questions and tools</h1>
  <p><img class="banner bordering" src="research.png"></p>
  <br>
  <h2>What is a research question?</h2>
  <p>A research question pinpoints exactly what you want to find out in your work. A good research question is essential to guide your research paper, dissertation, or thesis.</p>
  <h3>All research questions should be:</h3>
  <p>•	Focused on a single problem or issue</p>
  <p>•	Researchable using primary and/or secondary sources</p>
  <p>•	Feasible to answer within the timeframe and practical constraints</p>
  <p>•	Specific enough to answer thoroughly</p>
  <p>•	Complex enough to develop the answer over the space of a paper or thesis</p>
  <p>•	Relevant to your field of study and/or society more broadly</p>
  <br>
  <p>You will usually write a single research question to guide your progress in a research paper or academic essay. Your answer then forms your thesis statement—the central assertion or position that your paper will argue for.A bigger research project, such as a thesis or dissertation, may necessitate multiple research questions or problem statements. However, they should all be clearly connected and focused around a central research problem.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>How does one write a strong research question?</h3>
  <p>•	Choose your topic</p>
  <p>•	Do some preliminary reading about the current state of the field</p>
  <p>•	Narrow your focus to a specific niche so that there is a workable goal</p>
  <p>•	Identify the research problem that you will address</p>
  <p>The way you frame your question depends on what your research aims to achieve. The table below shows some examples of how you might formulate questions for different purposes.</p>
  <p>You can use tools like chat GPT to help brainstorm a good question for potential research questions</p>
  <p>Remember to use Ai like chat GPT responsibly and do not blindly copy off of it</p>
  <p>When writing a question these are the general things to look for:</p>
  <p>•	Clear and focused. In other words, the question should clearly state what the writer needs to do.</p>
  <p>•	Not too broad and not too narrow. The question should have an appropriate scope. If the question is too broad it will not be possible to answer it thoroughly within the word limit. If it is too narrow you will not have enough to write about and you will struggle to develop a strong argument (see the activity below for examples).</p>
  <p>•	Not too easy to answer. For example, the question should require more than a simple yes or no answer.</p>
  <p>•	Not too difficult to answer. You must be able to answer the question thoroughly within the given timeframe and word limit.</p>
  <p>•	Researchable. You must have access to a suitable amount of quality research materials, such as academic books and refereed journal articles.</p>
  <p>•	Analytical rather than descriptive. In other words, your research question should allow you to produce an analysis of an issue or problem rather than a simple description of it</p>
  <br>
  <p>Here are some examples of good and bad research questions
  </p>
  <h3>Bad and why:</h3>
  <p>What effect does social media have on your brain</p>
  <p>Explanation<br> The question is not specific enough</p>
  <h3>Good and why:</h3>
  <p>What effect does daily use of X(Twiiter) have on the attention span of 12- to 16- year-olds</p>
  <p>Explanation<br> The question is more researchable using qualitative and quantitative data collection</p>
  <br>
  <h2>In conclusion</h2>
  <p>A good research question it often quite hard to get but with enough practice and concentration you can get a good research question which will be specific and make your life easier when researching and doing the topic</p>
