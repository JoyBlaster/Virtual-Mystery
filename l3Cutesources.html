  <h2>Citing your sources correctly</h2>
  <p>With all this talk about sources in the previous lessons how does one cite the sources they use correctly?<br>
  With all this being said lets begin</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Citing your sources correctly</h2>
  <p>Every time you quote or paraphrase, you must include an in-text or footnote citation clearly identifying the original author. Each citation must correspond to a full reference in the reference list or bibliography at the end of your paper.</p>
  <br>
  <p>This acknowledges the source of your information, avoiding plagiarism, and it helps your readers locate the source for themselves if they would like to learn more.
    <br>
  There are many different citation styles, each with its own rules. A few common styles are APA, MLA, and Chicago. Your instructor may assign a particular style for you to use, or you may be able to choose. The most important thing is to apply one style consistently throughout the text.
</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Citations styles</h2>
  <p>The credits will show 2 styles of citations, APA and Harvard style of citation but we will only focus on APA for now</p>
  <h2>APA Reference style</h2>
  <br>
  <h2>What to do</h2>
  <h2>Year of publication</h2>
  <p>In round brackets followed by a full stop e.g (2016)</p>
  <h2>Article titles</h2>
  <p>Not italicised nor enclosed in quotations marks; only the first letter is capitalised e.g Effects of quitting smoking</p>
  <h2>Book titles</h2>
  <p>Capitalise only the first letter of the first word(unless the word is a proper noun); italicise book titles e.g Service Marketing</p>
  <h2>Book chapters</h2>
  <p>Page numbers for book chapters are given immediately after book title in round brackets<br> e.g Cross-cultural education(pp.75-105)</p>
  <h2>Journal titles</h2>
  <p>Italicise journal titles including the volume number; every first letter of major words in the journal title is capitalised <br> e.g Health Psychology</p>
  <h2>Internet sources</h2>
  <p>For online sources with doi* , it should be indicated as URL<br>e.g http://doi.org/10.1080.1422200410001676305<br>
  *DOI is short for digital object identifier. All legitimate items published online have DOI. Use this instead of URL if provided.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>What not to do</h2>
  <h2>No retrieval date</h2>
  <p>Does not include retrieval date and "Retrieved from" for online sources. URLs should be embedded in the reference</p>
  <h2>No database name require</h2>
  <p>Not necessary to include the name of the database when referemcing online journals or eBook collections</p>
  <h2>No publisher location</h2>
  <p>Publisher location is no longer included in the reference</p>
  <h2>In conclusion</h2>
  <p>So when researching for a thesis or an important research quesiton, remember when citing sources to cite properly using one of the many citation styles.You may have learnt APA for now but there are still alot more to learn out there. </p>
