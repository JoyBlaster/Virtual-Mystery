  <h2>What is online privacy?</h2>
  <p>Online privacy, also known as Internet privacy or digital privacy, is the ability to control how much of your information (such as browsing, financial, and potentially sensitive personal data) third parties can collect and use when you go online.</p>
  <br><br>
  <h2>Why is online privacy important?</h2>
  <p>In recent years, the importance of Internet privacy has grown tremendously since related cyber threats often put users’ security at enormous risk. While technology advances, people tend to digitize almost all spheres of their lives, from managing their finances to communicating with friends and buying goods. But the more information we share online, the greater the chance for threat actors to compromise it. </p>
  <br><br>
  <h2>How does one protect online privacy?</h2>
  <p>Since We know how importnant it is to protect your online privacy, here are 8 tips to help you protect it from harm.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>1. Updating your software</h3>
  <p>Updating your operating system and software won’t take much time. But this simple trick can save the day when it comes to your online privacy and security. The thing is that developers often fix system vulnerabilities and issues leading to hacks and data thefts. All you have to do is introduce those improvements to your device. </p>
  <br>
  <h3>2. Use antivirus software and a firewall</h3>
  <p>Many forms of malware and viruses are designed to infect your system and steal your data. Some of them may be sitting in your device’s software for weeks or even months, collecting your private information and sending it directly to hackers. That is why installing and regularly updating a powerful antivirus is a must. Another important measure is to activate your device’s firewall to keep yourself away from malicious Internet traffic.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>3. Adopt 2 factor authentication</h3>
  <p>Most reliable websites and apps allow users to enhance their safety with the help of the multi-factor or two-factor authentication (2FA) protocol. It’s an additional step one takes when entering a personal account. For instance, when you log into your Instagram, you will not only use your password, but also prove your identity through an SMS sent to your phone. Therefore, it is a very reliable and useful tool in helping to keep your online privacy safe.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>4. Protect yourself on public networks</h3>
  <p>Connecting to a public Wi-Fi network while away from home is another noteworthy privacy-related threat. Malicious actors often use unprotected hotspots to conduct man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. They put themselves between your device and the network it’s connected to – and then steal your personal information from right under your nose. The best solution against public Wi-Fi dangers is a virtual private network (VPN) – we will discuss the benefits of this powerful tool later on.</p>
  <br>
  <p>So in conclusion, avoid typing your passwords on public networks and do not look at important information without a secure internet connection </p>
  <br>
  <h3>5. Create strong passwords</h3>
  <p>Remember we mentioned password stuffing among the worst online habits for your privacy? Well, apart from not repeating your password on different accounts, here are some more tips in this regard.</p>
  <br>
  <p> .Use strong passwords that contain letters (upper and lower case), numbers, and symbols. Don’t use your personal information or dictionary words in it.</p>
  <br>
  <p>. Regularly update your credentials.</p>
  <br>
  <p>.Store your passwords in a safe place. You can use a password manager tool like LastPass, MacPass, or Keeper.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>6. Avoid using apps that will compromise your privacy</h3>
  <p>Let’s not beat around the bush here – most apps, even those provided by well-known and reputable service providers, are somewhat harmful to your privacy. We have talked about it in detail in our article about the worst apps for privacy concerns. Here, we will say that this is particularly the case for applications installed from unverified marketplaces. So it’s worth turning to the official ones instead. </P>
  <p> Another important thing you can do is manage your apps’ privacy settings. For example, App Sandbox offered by iOS allows users to control what information a particular application can access. A similar solution was recently introduced by Android developers</p>
  <h3>7. Avoid oversharing your information</h3>
  <p>You wouldn’t reveal your bank credentials, ID card number, or home address to a stranger in the street, would you? The same applies to your private data when you go online. However, it’s less clear who can access and compromise this information on the Internet. So people often neglect those risks. The main takeaway here is, the more personal information you keep to yourself, the better. So try not to overshare when it’s unnecessary, and always check if a website or app is reliable before filling out any forms that require your data.</p>
  <p>In general be careful of what you post or share online, because it is often hard to pernamently erase and can be found by people many years later. So, be careful of what you post since in the future employers may find it when checking on your history</p>
  <br>
  <h3>8. Use a VPN</h3>
  <p>You can resolve many privacy-related issues on your own. But with a powerful solution at hand protecting your data and digital identity, you will feel much more confident. That’s where a VPN comes into play. This tool will keep you away from numerous online dangers and make your browsing activities invisible to online snoopers, hackers, ISPs, and other third parties. Here are the three main benefits privacy-conscious users can gain with a VPN</p>
  <p>1. It protects you from cyber threats. A VPN is an effective way to defend yourself against public network risks, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, phishing scams, malicious links, and shady websites. </p>
  <p>2. It prevents unwanted tracking and surveillance. One of the main purposes of a VPN is to protect you from third-party monitoring. It hides your real IP and alters it with the address of a remote VPN server. So snoopers can’t trace the movement of your traffic and its destination. In particular, no one can see the websites you visit, files you download, and messages you send and receive.</p>
  <p>3. It encrypts your data. A VPN covers your traffic with reliable encryption. It means that your communications, search queries, and any information you type on the web are transformed into gibberish text no one can understand before it’s decrypted. Besides, VPN protocols ensure a stable and secure connection when your data travels through an encrypted tunnel.</p>
  <br>
