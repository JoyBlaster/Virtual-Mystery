  <h2>What is the purpose of malware?</h2>
  <p>Malicious software (malware) is harmful software that enters a computer system without the ownerâ€™s knowledge or consent. This refers to a wide variety of damaging or annoying software that is designed to harm a computer system or network. Malware can be used to steal data, damage or destroy files.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Primary objectives of malware</h3>
  <p>1. Infecting systems</p>
  <P>2. Concealing its purpose</P>
  <p>3. Making profit</p>
  <p>With all that being said lets look at the types of malware that can infect your computer</p>
  <h2>Viruses</h2>
  <p>When the infected program is launched, the virus activates its malicious payload and replicates itself by spreading to another file on same computer. 
  Viruses may display an annoying message or be much more harmful.
</p>
  <h3>Examples of virus actions</h3>
  <p>1. Cause a computer to repeatedly crash</p>
  <p>2.Erase files from or reformat hard drive</p>
  <p>3. Turn off computer's security settings</p>
  <p>Virus cannot automatically spread to another computer. They rely on user action to spread. This may be done through attaching to harmless-looking files or the transference of infected files.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Worm</h2>
  <p>Worm is a malicious program which exploits application or operating system vulnerability by sending copies of itself to other network devices.
  Worms may consume resources or leave behind a payload to harm infected systems.
</p>
  <h3>Examples of worm actions</h3>
  <p>1. Deleting computer files</p>
  <p>2. Allowing remote control of a computer by an attacker</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Trojan</h2>
  <p>Trojans are programs that do something other than advertised. They are typically executable programs which contain hidden code that launches an attack. Sometimes they are made to appear as data files.</p>
  <h3>Example of trojan actions</h3>
  <p>1. User downloads "free calender program"</p>
  <p>2. Program scans system for credit card numbers and passwords</p>
  <p>3. Transmits information to attacker through network</p>
  <br>
