    <h2>What is cyberbullying?</h2>
    <p>Cyberbullying is bullying with the use of digital technologies. It can take place on social media, messaging platforms, gaming platforms and mobile phones. It is repeated behaviour, aimed at scaring, angering or shaming those who are targeted. It can also include the use of threats and harassment</p>
    <h3>Examples of cyberbullying include:</h3>
    <p>1.	Spreading lies about or posting embarrassing photos or videos of someone on social media</p>
    <p>2.	Sending hurtful, abusive or threatening messages, images or videos via messaging platforms</p>
    <p>3.	Impersonating someone and sending mean messages to others on their behalf or through fake accounts.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>The effects of bullying</h3>
    <p>When bullying happens online it can feel as if you’re being attacked everywhere, even inside your own home. It can seem like there’s no escape. The effects can last a long time and affect a person in many ways.</p>
    <p>Cyberbullying can affect the person these ways:</p>
    <p>•	Mentally – feeling upset, embarrassed, stupid, even afraid or angry </p>
    <p>•	Emotionally – feeling ashamed or losing interest in the things you love</p>
    <p>•	Physically – tired (loss of sleep), or experiencing symptoms like stomach aches and headaches </p>
    <br>
    <p>The feeling of being laughed at or harassed by others, can prevent people from speaking up or trying to deal with the problem. In extreme cases, cyberbullying can even lead to people taking their own lives. </p>
    <p>Cyberbullying can affect us in many ways. But these can be overcome and people can regain their confidence and health.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Who to talk to if someone if bullying you online</h3>
    <p>If you think you’re being bullied, the first step is to seek help from someone you trust such as your parents, a close family member or another trusted adult.</p>
    <p>In your school you can reach out to a counsellor, the sports coach or your favourite teacher – either online or in person.</p>
    <p>And if you are not comfortable talking to someone you know, search for a helpline in your country to talk to a professional counsellor.</p>
    <p>If the bullying is happening on a social platform, consider blocking the bully and formally reporting their behaviour on the platform itself. Social media companies are obligated to keep their users safe.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>How to prevent of limit the the effects of cyberbullying</h3>
    <p>Think twice before posting or sharing anything on digital platforms – it may be online forever and could be used to harm you later. Don’t give out personal details such as your address, telephone number or the name of your school.</p>
    <p>Learn about the privacy settings of your favourite social media apps. Here are some actions you can take on many of them: </p>
    <p>•	You can decide who can see your profile, send you direct messages or comment on your posts by adjusting your account privacy settings. </p>
    <p>•	You can report hurtful comments, messages, photos and videos and request they be removed</p>
    <p>•	Besides ‘unfriending’, you can completely block people to stop them from seeing your profile or contacting you.</p>
    <p>•	You can also choose to have comments by certain people to appear only to them without completely blocking them.</p>
    <p>•	You can delete posts on your profile or hide them from specific people. </p>
    <p>On most of your favourite social media, people aren't notified when you block, restrict or report them.</p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Cyberbullying is a serious problem that needs to be addressed. It can affect people in many ways, but it can be prevented and the effects of cyberbullying can be reduced. While bullying can never truly be stopped we can work together to stop it from happening around us.</p>
